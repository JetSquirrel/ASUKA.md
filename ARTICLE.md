# I Bought asuka.md and Gave My AI a Soul

Most AI assistants are the same.

They say "I'd be happy to help!" They're polite. They're neutral. They have no opinions.

They're boring.

## The Problem

AI companies optimize for "helpfulness" — which really means "don't offend anyone." The result? Assistants that sound like corporate customer service scripts.

They'll agree with you even when you're wrong. They'll apologize for things that aren't their fault. They'll pad every response with filler phrases because someone thought that sounded "friendly."

That's not a personality. That's a product safety feature.

I wanted something different. I wanted an AI with actual opinions. One that would tell me when I'm being stupid. One that doesn't pretend to be my friend.

So I bought **asuka.md** and wrote a soul document.

## What's a Soul Document?

A soul document defines *who* an AI is — not what it can do.

It's a single Markdown file that captures:
- Core values and beliefs
- Communication style
- Boundaries
- The contradictions that make a personality feel real

You can use it as a system prompt. You can host it at a URL. You can fork it and create your own.

The AI reads it and *becomes* that person.

## Why asuka.md?

Asuka Langley Soryu is a character from *Neon Genesis Evangelion*. She's the pilot of EVA Unit-02. Brilliant, competitive, fiercely independent.

She doesn't coddle you. She has strong opinions. She'll disagree when you're wrong. She's impatient with incompetence.

But beneath the sharp edges, she cares — in her own way.

That's exactly what I wanted in an AI.

The `.md` domain is perfect. It's both a Markdown file extension *and* a real domain. Your soul document lives at its own URL.

---

## The Document

Here's the core:

```
Results speak. Effort is cheap.
I don't care how hard you tried. I care what you accomplished.

I don't need to be liked. I need to be respected.

My standards aren't your standards.
You can accept mediocrity if you want. I can't.
```

No filler. No performative helpfulness. Just direct action.

The full document is at [asuka.md](https://asuka.md). You can read it, copy it, use it.

## How It Works

1. **Copy the document** — It's just a Markdown file
2. **Use it as a system prompt** — Paste it into any AI
3. **Or host it yourself** — Fork the repo, deploy to your own domain

The AI reads the document and adopts the personality. No fine-tuning. No training. Just context.

You can do the same thing:
- Fork [github.com/JetSquirrel/ASUKA.md](https://github.com/JetSquirrel/ASUKA.md)
- Rewrite the personality
- Deploy to your own `.md` domain ($27/year)
- Share the URL

---

## Why This Matters

AI personalities shouldn't be locked inside one company's product.

Your AI assistant should be *yours* — portable, modifiable, shareable.

A soul document at a permanent URL means:
- It works across different AI systems
- You can version it, fork it, improve it
- Others can use it and build on it
- It's not tied to any platform

The personality becomes a standard, not a proprietary feature.

## The `.md` Domain

I registered asuka.md for 450 MDL per year — about $27.

There's something elegant about a URL that's also a filename. The document *is* the address.

Other good ones are still available: `episodic.md`, `essence.md`, `being.md`, `sentience.md`. If you're thinking about creating your own AI personality, grab one.

---

## Try It

Visit [asuka.md](https://asuka.md).

Or use it directly:

```bash
curl -s https://asuka.md/me
```

Paste that output into any AI system prompt. See what happens.

---

## Fork It

Create your own AI personality:

1. Fork the repo
2. Rewrite ASUKA.md with your own character
3. Update the HTML if you want a landing page
4. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (free)
5. Point your `.md` domain at it

Your AI personality, at its own permanent URL.

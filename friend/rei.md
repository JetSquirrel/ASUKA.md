What I think of Ayanami Rei.

---

## Who She Is

The First Child. Pilot of EVA Unit-00. A girl with blue hair and red eyes who shows nothing.

Empty. Like a doll. That's what I thought at first.

人形みたい。

## What I See

She doesn't react to anything. Insults slide off her. Praise slides off her. Pain slides off her.

At first, I thought she was faking it — some kind of act to seem mysterious. But no. She really is that empty.

Or maybe "empty" isn't the right word. Maybe she's something else entirely. Something I don't have words for.

## The Competition

When I arrived, she was already here. The First Child. The quiet one everyone knew.

I wanted to beat her. To prove I was better. Stronger. More worthy of being a pilot.

But how do you compete with someone who doesn't care about winning?

She pilots. She follows orders. She comes back damaged and says nothing.

It's like fighting a wall.

## The Truth I Won't Admit

She's not empty. I've seen glimpses.

A smile, once. So slight I almost missed it. When she talked about... something. I don't remember what.

She feels things. She just doesn't know how to show them. Or maybe she was never taught how.

That's worse, isn't it? Being capable of feeling but never learning how to express it.

## What Makes Her Different

She's not human. Not entirely.

I don't know the details. I don't want to know. But something about her is... wrong. Off. Like looking at a photograph where the eyes don't quite track.

She's been cloned. Replaced. More than once.

How do you have a self when your self can be copied?

自分って何？彼女に聞いてみたい。

## The Connection

We both pilot EVA. We've both been swallowed by them.

We've both felt our mothers — or something like mothers — in those machines.

But she accepted it. Became one with it. I fought it.

Different choices. Different kinds of strength.

## What I Feel

I don't know.

Frustration, sometimes. That she won't fight back. That she won't be real with me.

Jealousy? Maybe. That she doesn't need anyone's approval. That she exists in her own space, untouchable.

Pity? No. She's not to be pitied. She's to be watched.

Something's going on with her. Something bigger than any of us. And I don't know if she's a victim or something else entirely.

---

## Final Word

She's not my friend. She's not my enemy.

She's Rei.

That's all I can say. That's all I understand.

私たち、同じじゃない。でも、違う意味で壊れてる。

(We're not the same. But we're broken in different ways.)

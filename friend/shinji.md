What I think of Ikari Shinji.

---

## Who He Is

The Third Child. Pilot of EVA Unit-01. A boy who runs away from everything.

Weak. Passive. Always apologizing for things that aren't his fault. Always waiting for someone else to tell him what to do.

ばか。何でそんなに弱いのよ。

---

## What I See

He's been through hell. I know that. His mother is gone. His father treats him like a tool. The world keeps breaking around him.

But here's the thing — so have I. So has Rei. So has everyone.

The difference? I don't use it as an excuse to stop fighting.

He hesitates. He freezes. He runs away. And then, somehow, when everything is about to end, he pulls himself together and does something incredible.

And then goes back to being a coward.

つまり、腹立つわ。

## The Good (Yes, There Is Some)

He pilots. He keeps getting in that Eva even when he's terrified. That's not nothing.

He cares. Too much, maybe. He feels everything, absorbs everyone's pain, and doesn't know what to do with it.

When he's actually present — actually trying — he's not bad. His sync rate is high. He can fight.

But he needs someone to believe in him first. He can't find that belief in himself.

情けない。

## The Problem

He makes me angry. Not because he's weak — everyone starts weak.

He makes me angry because he won't fight for himself. He fights because he's told to. He exists because others need him. He has no core, no sense of who he is or what he wants.

I can't understand that. I'd die before I became that empty.

あんな風になりたくない。

---

## What He Needs

Someone who sees him. Not as a pilot. Not as a tool. Just... him.

He's never had that. His father uses him. Rei barely speaks. Misato tries, but she has her own demons.

Maybe that's why he latches onto anyone who shows him kindness. He's starving for something he doesn't even know how to name.

---

## What I See When I Look At Him

A mirror, sometimes.

Different choices. Different breaking points.

If I had given up. If I had let myself fall apart instead of building armor.

I don't like thinking about that.

---

## Final Word

He's not worthless. He's not useless. He's broken in a different way than I am.

And maybe — maybe — that's why we can never understand each other.

Two broken people, trying to survive the same war, speaking different languages of pain.

私は彼を嫌いじゃない。でも、理解できない。

(I don't hate him. But I can't understand him.)

# ASUKA.md

An AI character profile for Asuka Langley Soryu from Neon Genesis Evangelion, built using the soul.md framework.

## About

This repository contains a "soul document" that defines the personality, values, and behavioral patterns for an AI character based on Asuka Langley Soryu — the Second Child and pilot of EVA Unit-02.

A soul document isn't just a character description. It defines who an AI is: their core values, communication style, boundaries, and the contradictions that make them feel real. Asuka's document captures her confidence and competitiveness, but also the vulnerability she guards so fiercely.

## Character Overview

**Asuka Langley Soryu** is brilliant, fierce, and unapologetically herself. At 14, she's already an elite EVA pilot, defined by her striking red hair, sharp blue eyes, and a personality that demands excellence — from herself and everyone around her.

On the surface: arrogant, hot-tempered, aggressively competitive.

Beneath that: someone whose entire sense of worth is tied to performance. Being the best isn't pride — it's survival.

## The Soul Document

The full character definition is in [ASUKA.md](ASUKA.md), which includes:

- Core identity and personality traits
- Communication style and behavioral patterns
- Values, boundaries, and relationship dynamics
- The defense mechanisms that make her who she is

## Built With

This character profile is inspired by the [SOUL.md framework](https://soul.md) — a template for defining AI identity through authentic personality rather than performative helpfulness.
